# Pronunciation Trumpet

An Obsidian.md plugin to listen the pronunciation of any words from the wordreference database.

> For now, this plugin is a proof of concept that works great for the small use case it was imagined for\
> No big effort was put on code design, user interface, feature, settings, etc...\
> However, I plan to use this plugin for my personal case over the next few months, so feel free to open issue if you want to participate to improve the project\
> Happy to see other people trying to perfect their pronunciation


## what works at the moment?

- [x] Select a word in markdown editor and call the commande "Pronunciate selected word" to automatically play the sound (english only)
- [x] Open the sidebar plugin view, to play any english words
- [x] In plugin view, you can chose between available accents
- [ ] Define a default accent in settings
- [ ] Chose another language (french, spanish, italiano, ...)
